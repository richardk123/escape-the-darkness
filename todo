[x] Setup window with triangle and imgui
[x] Support build for multiple platforms
[x] Load mesh
[x] Prepare buffer wrapper
[x] Setup zed with newest zsl
[x] Support dynamic mesh
[x] Support multiple instances
[x] Improve error handling
[x] Support gui
[x] Support camera movement
[x] Support playing simple sound
[ ] Create wav parser, transform the data to u8|u16 mono source,
[ ] Create SoundManager, track playing sounds, auto deinit them after they finish
[ ] Push all sounds data to GPU storage buffer (once), current playing sounds state to uniform buffer(every frame)
[ ] Create compute shader that use current playing state from uniform buffer to write to !!!storage texture + clear storage texture with another compute shader
[ ] use encoder.copyTextureToTexture(storageTexture, sampledTexture) so it can be used in fragment shader
[ ] create quad and display the texture to debug the data
[ ] Visualise sounds on fragment shader using the sounds data texture (texture has faster random access then storage buffer)
